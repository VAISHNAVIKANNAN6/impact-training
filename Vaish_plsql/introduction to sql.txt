Introduction to SQL

What is SQL (Structured Query Language)?
SQL vs NoSQL
Types of SQL: DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), DCL (Data Control Language), TCL (Transaction Control Language)
Database Basics

What is a Database?
What is a DBMS (Database Management System)?
Types of Databases: Relational, Non-relational, etc.
Database Schema and Tables
SQL Data Types

Numeric Data Types (INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL)
String Data Types (CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT)
Date and Time Data Types (DATE, TIME, DATETIME)
Other Data Types (BOOLEAN, BLOB, etc.)
Basic SQL Commands

SELECT: Querying data from a table
INSERT: Inserting data into a table
UPDATE: Updating existing data in a table
DELETE: Deleting data from a table
CREATE TABLE: Creating a new table
ALTER TABLE: Modifying an existing table
DROP TABLE: Deleting a table from the database
SQL Clauses

WHERE: Filtering records
ORDER BY: Sorting results
GROUP BY: Grouping data for aggregation
HAVING: Filtering grouped data
LIMIT/OFFSET: Limiting results
SQL Operators

Comparison Operators: =, <>, <, >, <=, >=
Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT
Wildcards: LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, IS NULL
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /
SQL Joins

INNER JOIN: Combining rows from two tables where there is a match
LEFT JOIN (OUTER JOIN): Includes all records from the left table and matching records from the right table
RIGHT JOIN (OUTER JOIN): Includes all records from the right table and matching records from the left table
FULL JOIN (OUTER JOIN): Includes records when there is a match in either left or right table
SQL Subqueries

Single-row Subquery
Multi-row Subquery
Correlated Subquery
SQL Functions

Aggregate Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
String Functions: CONCAT(), LENGTH(), UPPER(), LOWER(), SUBSTRING()
Date Functions: NOW(), CURDATE(), DATE_ADD(), DATEDIFF()
Mathematical Functions: ROUND(), CEIL(), FLOOR()
SQL Constraints

PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record in a table
FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between two tables
UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are unique
NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values
CHECK: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a condition
Normalization

Concept of Normalization
Normal Forms: 1NF (First Normal Form), 2NF (Second Normal Form), 3NF (Third Normal Form), BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
Indexes

What is an Index?
Types of Indexes: Unique Index, Composite Index
Benefits and Drawbacks of Indexing
Transactions

ACID Properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
COMMIT: Saving changes to the database
ROLLBACK: Reverting changes to the database
SAVEPOINT: Creating a save point within a transaction
SQL Views

What is a View?
Benefits of Using Views
Creating and Dropping Views
SQL Security

User Authentication and Authorization
GRANT and REVOKE commands
Role-based Access Control
